3 Set theory clauses
In this chapter, you'll learn more about set theory using Venn diagrams and you will be introduced to union, union all, intersect, and except clauses. You'll finish by investigating semi-joins and anti-joins, which provide a nice introduction to subqueries.

EXERCISE
Union
Near query result to the right, you will see two new tables with names economies2010 and economies2015.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Combine these two tables into one table containing all of the fields in economies2010. The economies table is also included for reference.
Sort this resulting single table by country code and then by year, both in ascending order.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

-- pick specified columns from 2010 table
SELECT *
-- 2010 table will be on top
FROM economies2010
-- which set theory clause?
UNION
-- pick specified columns from 2015 table
SELECT *
-- 2015 table on the bottom
FROM economies2015
-- order accordingly
ORDER BY code, year;

EXERCISE
Union (2)
UNION can also be used to determine all occurrences of a field across multiple tables. Try out this exercise with no starter code.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Determine all (non-duplicated) country codes in either the cities or the currencies table. The result should be a table with only one field called country_code.
Sort by country_code in alphabetical order.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

SELECT country_code
FROM cities
UNION
SELECT code
FROM currencies
ORDER BY country_code;

EXERCISE
Union all
As you saw, duplicates were removed from the previous two exercises by using UNION.

To include duplicates, you can use UNION ALL.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Determine all combinations (include duplicates) of country code and year that exist in either the economies or the populations tables. Order by code then year.
The result of the query should only have two columns/fields.
Think about how many records this query should result in.
You'll use code very similar to this in your next exercise after the video. Make note of this code after completing it.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

SELECT code, year
FROM economies
UNION ALL
SELECT country_code, year
FROM populations
ORDER BY code, year;

EXERCISE
Intersect
Repeat the previous UNION ALL exercise, this time looking at the records in common for country code and year for the economies and populations tables.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Again, order by code and then by year, both in ascending order.
Note the number of records here (given at the bottom of query result) compared to the similar UNION ALL query result (814 records).
Take Hint (-30 XP)

SELECT code, year
FROM economies
INTERSECT
SELECT country_code, year
FROM populations
ORDER BY code, year;

EXERCISE
Intersect (2)
As you think about major world cities and their corresponding country, you may ask which countries also have a city with the same name as their country name?

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Use INTERSECT to answer this question with countries and cities!

Take Hint (-30 XP)

SELECT name
FROM countries
INTERSECT
SELECT name
FROM cities;

Review union and intersect
Which of the following combinations of terms and definitions is correct?

ANSWER THE QUESTION
50 XP
Possible Answers
UNION: returns all records (potentially duplicates) in both tables
press 1
UNION ALL: returns only unique records
press 2
INTERSECT: returns only records appearing in both tables
press 3
None of the above are matched correctly
press 4
Take Hint (-15 XP)

Answer #3 - INTERSECT: returns only records appearing in both tables

EXERCISE
Except
Get the names of cities in cities which are not noted as capital cities in countries as a single field result.

Note that there are some countries in the world that are not included in the countries table, which will result in some cities not being labeled as capital cities when in fact they are.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Order the resulting field in ascending order.
Can you spot the city/cities that are actually capital cities which this query misses?
Take Hint (-30 XP)

SELECT city.name
FROM cities AS city
EXCEPT
SELECT country.capital
FROM countries AS country
ORDER BY name;

EXERCISE
Except (2)
Now you will complete the previous query in reverse!

Determine the names of capital cities that are not listed in the cities table.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Order by capital in ascending order.
The cities table contains information about 236 of the world's most populous cities. The result of your query may surprise you in terms of the number of capital cities that DO NOT appear in this list!
Take Hint (-30 XP)

SELECT country.capital
FROM countries AS country
EXCEPT
SELECT city.name
FROM cities AS city
ORDER BY capital;
