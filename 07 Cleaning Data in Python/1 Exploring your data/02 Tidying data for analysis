Recognizing tidy data
For data to be tidy, it must have:

Each variable as a separate column.
Each row as a separate observation.
As a data scientist, you'll encounter data that is represented in a variety of different ways, so it is important to be able to recognize tidy (or untidy) data when you see it.

In this exercise, two example datasets have been pre-loaded into the DataFrames df1 and df2. Only one of them is tidy. Your job is to explore these further in the IPython Shell and identify the one that is not tidy, and why it is not tidy.

In the rest of this course, you will frequently be asked to explore the structure of DataFrames in the IPython Shell prior to performing different operations on them. Doing this will not only strengthen your comprehension of the data cleaning concepts covered in this course, but will also help you realize and take advantage of the relationship between working in the Shell and in the script.

EXERCISE
Reshaping your data using melt
Melting data is the process of turning columns of your data into rows of data. Consider the DataFrames from the previous exercise. In the tidy DataFrame, the variables Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp each had their own column. If, however, you wanted these variables to be in rows instead, you could melt the DataFrame. In doing so, however, you would make the data untidy! This is important to keep in mind: Depending on how your data is represented, you will have to reshape it differently.

In this exercise, you will practice melting a DataFrame using pd.melt(). There are two parameters you should be aware of: id_vars and value_vars. The id_vars represent the columns of the data you do not want to melt (i.e., keep it in its current shape), while the value_vars represent the columns you do wish to melt into rows. By default, if no value_vars are provided, all columns not set in the id_vars will be melted. This could save a bit of typing, depending on the number of columns that need to be melted.

The (tidy) DataFrame airquality has been pre-loaded. Your job is to melt its Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp columns into rows. Later in this chapter, you'll learn how to bring this melted DataFrame back into a tidy form.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Print the head of airquality.
Use pd.melt() to melt the Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp columns of airquality into rows. Do this by using id_vars to specify the columns you do not wish to melt: 'Month' and 'Day'.
Print the head of airquality_melt.

# Print the head of airquality
print(airquality.head())

# Melt airquality: airquality_melt
airquality_melt = pd.melt(frame=airquality, id_vars=['Month', 'Day'])

# Print the head of airquality_melt
print(airquality_melt.head())

EXERCISE
Customizing melted data
When melting DataFrames, it would be better to have column names more meaningful than variable and value.

The default names may work in certain situations, but it's best to always have data that is self explanatory.

You can rename the variable column by specifying an argument to the var_name parameter, and the value column by specifying an argument to the value_name parameter. You will now practice doing exactly this. The DataFrame airquality has been pre-loaded for you.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Print the head of airquality.
Melt the Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp columns of airquality into rows, with the default variable column renamed to 'measurement' and the default value column renamed to 'reading'. You can do this by specifying, respectively, the var_name and value_name parameters.
Print the head of airquality_melt.

# Print the head of airquality
print(airquality.head())

# Melt airquality: airquality_melt
airquality_melt = pd.melt(frame=airquality, id_vars=['Month', 'Day'], var_name='measurement', value_name='reading')

# Print the head of airquality_melt
print(airquality_melt.head())

EXERCISE
Pivot data
Pivoting data is the opposite of melting it. Remember the tidy form that the airquality DataFrame was in before you melted it? You'll now begin pivoting it back into that form using the .pivot_table() method!

While melting takes a set of columns and turns it into a single column, pivoting will create a new column for each unique value in a specified column.

.pivot_table() has an index parameter which you can use to specify the columns that you don't want pivoted: It is similar to the id_vars parameter of pd.melt(). Two other parameters that you have to specify are columns (the name of the column you want to pivot), and values (the values to be used when the column is pivoted). The melted DataFrame airquality_melt has been pre-loaded for you.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Print the head of airquality_melt.
Pivot airquality_melt by using .pivot_table() with the rows indexed by 'Month' and 'Day', the columns indexed by 'measurement', and the values populated with 'reading'.
Print the head of airquality_pivot.

# Print the head of airquality_melt
print(airquality_melt.head())

# Pivot airquality_melt: airquality_pivot
airquality_pivot = airquality_melt.pivot_table(index=['Month', 'Day'], columns='measurement', values='reading')

# Print the head of airquality_pivot
print(airquality_pivot.head())

EXERCISE
Resetting the index of a DataFrame
After pivoting airquality_melt in the previous exercise, you didn't quite get back the original DataFrame.

What you got back instead was a pandas DataFrame with a hierarchical index (also known as a MultiIndex).

Hierarchical indexes are covered in depth in Manipulating DataFrames with pandas. In essence, they allow you to group columns or rows by another variable - in this case, by 'Month' as well as 'Day'.

There's a very simple method you can use to get back the original DataFrame from the pivoted DataFrame: .reset_index(). Dan didn't show you how to use this method in the video, but you're now going to practice using it in this exercise to get back the original DataFrame from airquality_pivot, which has been pre-loaded.

INSTRUCTIONS

Print the index of airquality_pivot by accessing its .index attribute. This has been done for you.
Reset the index of airquality_pivot using its .reset_index() method.
Print the new index of airquality_pivot.
Print the head of airquality_pivot.

# Print the index of airquality_pivot
print(airquality_pivot.index)

# Reset the index of airquality_pivot: airquality_pivot_reset
airquality_pivot_reset = airquality_pivot.reset_index()

# Print the new index of airquality_pivot_reset
print(airquality_pivot_reset.index)

# Print the head of airquality_pivot_reset
print(airquality_pivot_reset.head())

EXERCISE
Pivoting duplicate values
So far, you've used the .pivot_table() method when there are multiple index values you want to hold constant during a pivot. In the video, Dan showed you how you can also use pivot tables to deal with duplicate values by providing an aggregation function through the aggfunc parameter. Here, you're going to combine both these uses of pivot tables.

Let's say your data collection method accidentally duplicated your dataset. Such a dataset, in which each row is duplicated, has been pre-loaded as airquality_dup. In addition, the airquality_melt DataFrame from the previous exercise has been pre-loaded. Explore their shapes in the IPython Shell by accessing their .shape attributes to confirm the duplicate rows present in airquality_dup.

You'll see that by using .pivot_table() and the aggfunc parameter, you can not only reshape your data, but also remove duplicates. Finally, you can then flatten the columns of the pivoted DataFrame using .reset_index().

NumPy and pandas have been imported as np and pd respectively.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Pivot airquality_dup by using .pivot_table() with the rows indexed by 'Month' and 'Day', the columns indexed by 'measurement', and the values populated with 'reading'. Use np.mean for the aggregation function.
Flatten airquality_pivot by resetting its index.
Print the head of airquality_pivot and then the original airquality DataFrame to compare their structure.

# Pivot airquality_dup: airquality_pivot

airquality_pivot = airquality_pivot.reset_index()

# Print the head of airquality_pivot
print(airquality_pivot.head())

# Print the head of airquality
print(airquality.head())

EXERCISE
Splitting a column with .str
The dataset you saw in the video, consisting of case counts of tuberculosis by country, year, gender, and age group, has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame as tb.

In this exercise, you're going to tidy the 'm014' column, which represents males aged 0-14 years of age. In order to parse this value, you need to extract the first letter into a new column for gender, and the rest into a column for age_group. Here, since you can parse values by position, you can take advantage of pandas' vectorized string slicing by using the str attribute of columns of type object.

Begin by printing the columns of tb in the IPython Shell using its .columns attribute, and take note of the problematic column.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Melt tb keeping 'country' and 'year' fixed.
Create a 'gender' column by slicing the first letter of the variable column of tb_melt.
Create an 'age_group' column by slicing the rest of the variable column of tb_melt.
Print the head of tb_melt. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the results!

# Melt tb: tb_melt
tb_melt = pd.melt(frame=tb, id_vars=['country', 'year'])

# Create the 'gender' column
tb_melt['gender'] = tb_melt.variable.str[0]

# Create the 'age_group' column
tb_melt['age_group'] = tb_melt.variable.str[1:]

# Print the head of tb_melt
print(tb_melt.head())

EXERCISE
Splitting a column with .split() and .get()
Another common way multiple variables are stored in columns is with a delimiter. You'll learn how to deal with such cases in this exercise, using a dataset consisting of Ebola cases and death counts by state and country. It has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame as ebola.

Print the columns of ebola in the IPython Shell using ebola.columns. Notice that the data has column names such as Cases_Guinea and Deaths_Guinea. Here, the underscore _ serves as a delimiter between the first part (cases or deaths), and the second part (country).

This time, you cannot directly slice the variable by position as in the previous exercise. You now need to use Python's built-in string method called .split(). By default, this method will split a string into parts separated by a space. However, in this case you want it to split by an underscore. You can do this on Cases_Guinea, for example, using Cases_Guinea.split('_'), which returns the list ['Cases', 'Guinea'].

The next challenge is to extract the first element of this list and assign it to a type variable, and the second element of the list to a country variable. You can accomplish this by accessing the str attribute of the column and using the .get() method to retrieve the 0 or 1 index, depending on the part you want.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Melt ebola using 'Date' and 'Day' as the id_vars, 'type_country' as the var_name, and 'counts' as the value_name.
Create a column called 'str_split' by splitting the 'type_country' column of ebola_melt on '_'. Note that you will first have to access the str attribute of type_country before you can use .split().
Create a column called 'type' by using the .get() method to retrieve index 0 of the 'str_split' column of ebola_melt.
Create a column called 'country' by using the .get() method to retrieve index 1 of the 'str_split' column of ebola_melt.
Print the head of ebola. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to view the results!

# Melt ebola: ebola_melt

# Create the 'type' column
ebola_melt['type'] = ebola_melt.str_split.str.get(0)

# Create the 'country' column
ebola_melt['country'] = ebola_melt.str_split.str.get(1)
