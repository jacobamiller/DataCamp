3 Aggregate Functions
This chapter builds on the first two by teaching you how to use aggregate functions to summarize your data and gain useful insights. Additionally, you'll learn about arithmetic in SQL, and how to use aliases to make your results more readable!

EXERCISE
Aggregate functions
Often, you will want to perform some calculation on the data in a database. SQL provides a few functions, called aggregate functions, to help you out with this.

For example,

SELECT AVG(budget)
FROM films;
gives you the average value from the budget column of the films table. Similarly, the MAX function returns the highest budget:

SELECT MAX(budget)
FROM films;
The SUM function returns the result of adding up the numeric values in a column:

SELECT SUM(budget)
FROM films;
You can probably guess what the MIN function does! Now it's your turn to try out some SQL functions.

INSTRUCTIONS
-- -- Use the SUM function to get the total duration of all films.
-- SELECT SUM(duration)
-- FROM films;

-- -- Get the average duration of all films.
-- SELECT AVG(duration)
-- FROM films;

-- -- Get the duration of the shortest film.
-- SELECT MIN(duration)
-- FROM films;

-- Get the duration of the longest film
SELECT MAX(duration)
FROM films;

EXERCISE
Aggregate functions practice
Good work. Aggregate functions are important to understand, so let's get some more practice!

INSTRUCTIONS 
-- -- Use the SUM function to get the total amount grossed by all films.
-- SELECT SUM(gross)
-- FROM films;

-- -- Get the average amount grossed by all films.
-- SELECT AVG(gross)
-- FROM films;

-- -- Get the amount grossed by the worst performing film.
-- SELECT MIN(gross)
-- FROM films;

-- Get the amount grossed by the best performing film.
SELECT MAX(gross)
FROM films;

EXERCISE
Combining aggregate functions with WHERE
Aggregate functions can be combined with the WHERE clause to gain further insights from your data.

For example, to get the total budget of movies made in the year 2010 or later:

SELECT SUM(budget)
FROM films
WHERE release_year >= 2010;
Now it's your turn!
