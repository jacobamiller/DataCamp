HIDE CHAPTER DETAILS

Filtering results
Congrats on finishing the first chapter! You now know how to select columns and perform basic counts. This chapter will focus on filtering your results.

In SQL, the WHERE keyword allows you to filter based on both text and numeric values in a table. There are a few different comparison operators you can use:

= equal
<> not equal
< less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal to
>= greater than or equal to
For example, you can filter text records such as title. The following code returns all films with the title 'Metropolis':

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE title = 'Metropolis';
Notice that the WHERE clause always comes after the FROM statement!

Note that in this course we will use <> and not != for the not equal operator, as per the SQL standard.

What does the following query return?
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 2000;

Answer #2 - Films released after the year 2000

EXERCISE
Simple filtering of numeric values
As you learned in the previous exercise, the WHERE clause can also be used to filter numeric records, such as years or ages.

For example, the following query selects all details for films with a budget over ten thousand dollars:

SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE budget > 10000;
Now it's your turn to use the WHERE clause to filter numeric values!

-- SELECT *
-- FROM films
-- WHERE 	release_year = 2016;

-- SELECT COUNT(*)
-- FROM films
-- WHERE 	release_year < 2000;

SELECT title, release_year
FROM films
WHERE 	release_year > 2000;

EXERCISE
Simple filtering of text
Remember, the WHERE clause can also be used to filter text results, such as names or countries.

For example, this query gets the titles of all films which were filmed in China:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE country = 'China';
Now it's your turn to practice using WHERE with text values!

Important: in PostgreSQL (the version of SQL we're using), you must use single quotes with WHERE.

INSTRUCTIONS 4/4

Get all details for all French language films.

Get the name and birth date of the person born on November 11th, 1974. Remember to use ISO date format ('1974-11-11')!

Get the number of Hindi language films.

Get all details for all films with an R certification.

-- SELECT *
-- FROM films
-- WHERE language = 'French';

-- SELECT *
-- FROM people
-- WHERE birthdate = '1974-11-11';

-- SELECT COUNT(*)
-- FROM films
-- WHERE language = 'Hindi';

SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE certification = 'R';

EXERCISE
WHERE AND
Often, you'll want to select data based on multiple conditions. You can build up your WHERE queries by combining multiple conditions with the AND keyword.

For example,

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 1994
AND release_year < 2000;
gives you the titles of films released between 1994 and 2000.

Note that you need to specify the column name separately for every AND condition, so the following would be invalid:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 1994 AND < 2000;
You can add as many AND conditions as you need!

-- SELECT title, release_year
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year < 2000
-- AND language = 'Spanish';

-- SELECT *
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year > 2000
-- AND language = 'Spanish';

SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 2000
AND release_year < 2010
AND language = 'Spanish';

WHERE AND OR
What if you want to select rows based on multiple conditions where some but not all of the conditions need to be met? For this, SQL has the OR operator.

For example, the following returns all films released in either 1994 or 2000:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year = 1994
OR release_year = 2000;
Note that you need to specify the column for every OR condition, so the following is invalid:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year = 1994 OR 2000;
When combining AND and OR, be sure to enclose the individual clauses in parentheses, like so:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)
AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');
Otherwise, due to SQL's precedence rules, you may not get the results you're expecting!

What does the OR operator do?

Answer #1 = Display only rows that meet at least one of the specified conditions.

EXERCISE
WHERE AND OR (2)
You now know how to select rows that meet some but not all conditions by combining AND and OR.

For example, the following query selects all films that were released in 1994 or 1995 which had a rating of PG or R.

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)
AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');
Now you'll write a query to get the title and release year of films released in the 90s which were in French or Spanish and which took in more than $2M gross.

It looks like a lot, but you can build the query up one step at a time to get comfortable with the underlying concept in each step. Let's go!

INSTRUCTIONS 3/3
30 XP
Finally, restrict the query to only return films that took in more than $2M gross.

-- SELECT title, release_year
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year >= 1990
-- AND release_year <= 1999;

-- SELECT title, release_year
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year >= 1990
-- AND release_year <= 1999
-- AND (language = 'French' OR language = 'Spanish');

SELECT title, release_year
FROM films
WHERE release_year >= 1990
AND release_year <= 1999
AND gross > 2000000
AND (language = 'French' OR language = 'Spanish');

Course Outline
BETWEEN
As you've learned, you can use the following query to get titles of all films released in and between 1994 and 2000:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year >= 1994
AND release_year <= 2000;
Checking for ranges like this is very common, so in SQL the BETWEEN keyword provides a useful shorthand for filtering values within a specified range. This query is equivalent to the one above:

SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year
BETWEEN 1994 AND 2000;
It's important to remember that BETWEEN is inclusive, meaning the beginning and end values are included in the results!

Answer #4 - Filter values in a specified range

EXERCISE
BETWEEN (2)
Similar to the WHERE clause, the BETWEEN clause can be used with multiple AND and OR operators, so you can build up your queries and make them even more powerful!

For example, suppose we have a table called kids. We can get the names of all kids between the ages of 2 and 12 from the United States:

SELECT name
FROM kids
WHERE age BETWEEN 2 AND 12
AND nationality = 'USA';
Take a go at using BETWEEN with AND on the films data to get the title and release year of all Spanish language films released between 1990 and 2000 (inclusive) with budgets over $100 million. We have broken the problem into smaller steps so that you can build the query as you go along!

-- -- Get the title and release year of all films released between 1990 and 2000 (inclusive).
-- SELECT title, release_year
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000;

-- -- Now, build on your previous query to select only films that have budgets over $100 million.
-- SELECT title, release_year
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000
-- AND budget > 100000000;

-- -- Now restrict the query to only return Spanish language films.
-- SELECT title, release_year
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000
-- AND budget > 100000000
-- AND language = 'Spanish';

-- Finally, modify to your previous query to include all Spanish language or French language films with the same criteria as before. Don't forget your parentheses!
SELECT title, release_year
FROM films
WHERE release_year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000
AND budget > 100000000
AND (language = 'Spanish' OR language = 'French');

-- -- Get the title and release year of all films released in 1990 or 2000 that were longer than two hours. Remember, duration is in minutes!
-- SELECT 	title, release_year
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year IN (1990, 2000)
-- AND duration > 120;

-- -- Get the title and language of all films which were in English, Spanish, or French.
-- SELECT 	title, language
-- FROM films
-- WHERE language IN ('English', 'Spanish', 'French');

EXERCISE
NULL and IS NULL
Now that you know what NULL is and what it's used for, it's time for some practice!

INSTRUCTIONS
-- -- Get the names of people who are still alive, i.e. whose death date is missing.
-- SELECT name
-- FROM people
-- WHERE deathdate IS NULL;

-- -- Get the title of every film which doesn't have a budget associated with it.
-- SELECT title
-- FROM films
-- WHERE budget IS NULL;

-- Get the number of films which don't have a language associated with them.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM films
WHERE language IS NULL;



-- Get the title and certification of all films with an NC-17 or R certification.
SELECT 	title, certification
FROM films
WHERE certification IN ('NC-17', 'R');

Introduction to NULL and IS NULL
In SQL, NULL represents a missing or unknown value. You can check for NULL values using the expression IS NULL. For example, to count the number of missing birth dates in the people table:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM people
WHERE birthdate IS NULL;
As you can see, IS NULL is useful when combined with WHERE to figure out what data you're missing.

Sometimes, you'll want to filter out missing values so you only get results which are not NULL. To do this, you can use the IS NOT NULL operator.

For example, this query gives the names of all people whose birth dates are not missing in the people table.

SELECT name
FROM people
WHERE birthdate IS NOT NULL;
What does NULL represent?

EXERCISE
LIKE and NOT LIKE
As you've seen, the WHERE clause can be used to filter text data. However, so far you've only been able to filter by specifying the exact text you're interested in. In the real world, often you'll want to search for a pattern rather than a specific text string.

In SQL, the LIKE operator can be used in a WHERE clause to search for a pattern in a column. To accomplish this, you use something called a wildcard as a placeholder for some other values. There are two wildcards you can use with LIKE:

The % wildcard will match zero, one, or many characters in text. For example, the following query matches companies like 'Data', 'DataC' 'DataCamp', 'DataMind', and so on:

SELECT name
FROM companies
WHERE name LIKE 'Data%';
The _ wildcard will match a single character. For example, the following query matches companies like 'DataCamp', 'DataComp', and so on:

SELECT name
FROM companies
WHERE name LIKE 'DataC_mp';
You can also use the NOT LIKE operator to find records that don't match the pattern you specify.

Got it? Let's practice!

-- -- Get the names of all people whose names begin with 'B'. The pattern you need is 'B%'.
-- SELECT name
-- FROM people
-- WHERE name LIKE 'B%'

-- -- Get the names of people whose names have 'r' as the second letter. The pattern you need is '_r%'.
-- SELECT name
-- FROM people
-- WHERE name LIKE '_r%'

-- Get the names of people whose names don't start with A. The pattern you need is 'A%'.
SELECT name
FROM people
WHERE name NOT LIKE 'A%'
