HIDE CHAPTER DETAILS

ORDER BY
Congratulations on making it this far! You now know how to select and filter your results.

In this chapter you'll learn how to sort and group your results to gain further insight. Let's go!

In SQL, the ORDER BY keyword is used to sort results in ascending or descending order according to the values of one or more columns.

By default ORDER BY will sort in ascending order. If you want to sort the results in descending order, you can use the DESC keyword. For example,

SELECT title
FROM films
ORDER BY release_year DESC;
gives you the titles of films sorted by release year, from newest to oldest.

How do you think ORDER BY sorts a column of text values by default?

Answer #1 - Alphabetically (A-Z)

EXERCISE
Sorting single columns
Now that you understand how ORDER BY works, give these exercises a go!

INSTRUCTIONS 

-- -- Get the names of people from the people table, sorted alphabetically.
-- SELECT name
-- FROM people
-- ORDER BY name;

-- -- Get the names of people, sorted by birth date.
-- SELECT name
-- FROM people
-- ORDER BY birthdate;

-- Get the birth date and name for every person, in order of when they were born.
SELECT birthdate, name
FROM people
ORDER BY birthdate;

EXERCISE
Sorting single columns (2)
Let's get some more practice with ORDER BY!

INSTRUCTIONS

-- Get the title of films released in 2000 or 2012, in the order they were released.
-- SELECT title
-- FROM films
-- WHERE (release_year = 2000 or release_year = 2012)
-- ORDER BY release_year

-- -- Get all details for all films except those released in 2015 and order them by duration.
-- SELECT *
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year <> 2015
-- ORDER BY duration

-- Get the title and gross earnings for movies which begin with the letter 'M' and order the results alphabetically.
SELECT title, gross
FROM films
WHERE title LIKE 'M%'
ORDER BY title

EXERCISE
Sorting single columns (DESC)
To order results in descending order, you can put the keyword DESC after your ORDER BY. For example, to get all the names in the people table, in reverse alphabetical order:

SELECT name
FROM people
ORDER BY name DESC;
Now practice using ORDER BY with DESC to sort single columns in descending order!

INSTRUCTIONS

-- -- Get the IMDB score and film ID for every film from the reviews table, sorted from highest to lowest score.
-- SELECT film_id, imdb_score
-- FROM reviews
-- ORDER BY imdb_score DESC;

-- -- Get the title for every film, in reverse order.
-- SELECT title
-- FROM films
-- ORDER BY title DESC;

-- Get the title and duration for every film, in order of longest duration to shortest.
SELECT title, duration
FROM films
ORDER BY duration DESC;

EXERCISE
Sorting multiple columns
ORDER BY can also be used to sort on multiple columns. It will sort by the first column specified, then sort by the next, then the next, and so on. For example,

SELECT birthdate, name
FROM people
ORDER BY birthdate, name;
sorts on birth dates first (oldest to newest) and then sorts on the names in alphabetical order. The order of columns is important!

Try using ORDER BY to sort multiple columns! Remember, to specify multiple columns you separate the column names with a comma.

INSTRUCTIONS 
-- -- Get the birth date and name of people in the people table, in order of when they were born and alphabetically by name.
-- SELECT birthdate, name
-- FROM people
-- ORDER BY birthdate, name;

-- -- Get the release year, duration, and title of films ordered by their release year and duration.
-- SELECT  release_year, duration, title
-- FROM films
-- ORDER BY release_year, duration;

-- -- Get certifications, release years, and titles of films ordered by certification (alphabetically) and release year.
-- SELECT  certification, release_year, title
-- FROM films
-- ORDER BY certification, release_year;

-- Get the names and birthdates of people ordered by name and birth date.
SELECT name, birthdate
FROM People
ORDER BY name, birthdate;

GROUP BY
Now you know how to sort results! Often you'll need to aggregate results. For example, you might want to count the number of male and female employees in your company. Here, what you want is to group all the males together and count them, and group all the females together and count them. In SQL, GROUP BY allows you to group a result by one or more columns, like so:

SELECT sex, count(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY sex;
This might give, for example:

sex	count
male	15
female	19

Commonly, GROUP BY is used with aggregate functions like COUNT() or MAX(). Note that GROUP BY always goes after the FROM clause!

EXERCISE
GROUP BY practice
As you've just seen, combining aggregate functions with GROUP BY can yield some powerful results!

A word of warning: SQL will return an error if you try to SELECT a field that is not in your GROUP BY clause without using it to calculate some kind of value about the entire group.

Note that you can combine GROUP BY with ORDER BY to group your results, calculate something about them, and then order your results. For example,

SELECT sex, count(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY sex
ORDER BY count DESC;
might return something like

sex	count
female	19
male	15

because there are more females at our company than males. Note also that ORDER BY always goes after GROUP BY. Let's try some exercises!

INSTRUCTIONS
-- -- Get the release year and count of films released in each year.
-- SELECT release_year, count(*)
-- FROM films
-- GROUP BY release_year
-- ORDER BY count;

-- -- Get the release year and average duration of all films, grouped by release year.
-- SELECT release_year, AVG(duration)
-- FROM films
-- GROUP BY release_year;

-- -- Get the release year and largest budget for all films, grouped by release year.
-- SELECT release_year, MAX(budget)
-- FROM films
-- GROUP BY release_year;

-- Get the IMDB score and count of film reviews grouped by IMDB score in the reviews table.
SELECT imdb_score, COUNT(film_id)
FROM reviews
GROUP BY imdb_score
ORDER BY imdb_score;

EXERCISE
GROUP BY practice (2)
Now practice your new skills by combining GROUP BY and ORDER BY with some more aggregate functions!

Make sure to always put the ORDER BY clause at the end of your query. You can't sort values that you haven't calculated yet!

INSTRUCTIONS
-- -- Get the release year and lowest gross earnings per release year.
-- SELECT release_year, MIN(gross)
-- FROM films
-- GROUP BY release_year
-- ORDER BY release_year; -- Not Needed

-- -- Get the language and total gross amount films in each language made.
-- SELECT language, SUM(gross)
-- FROM films
-- GROUP BY language
-- ORDER BY SUM(gross); -- Not Needed

-- -- Get the country and total budget spent making movies in each country.
-- SELECT country, SUM(budget)
-- FROM films
-- GROUP BY country
-- ORDER BY SUM(budget); -- Not Needed

-- -- Get the release year, country, and highest budget spent making a film for each year, for each country. Sort your results by release year and country.
-- SELECT release_year, country, MAX(budget)
-- FROM films
-- GROUP BY release_year, country
-- ORDER BY release_year; -- Not Needed

-- Get the country, release year, and lowest amount grossed per release year per country. Order your results by country and release year.
SELECT country, release_year, MIN(gross)
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year, country
ORDER BY country, release_year;

EXERCISE
HAVING a great time
In SQL, aggregate functions can't be used in WHERE clauses. For example, the following query is invalid:

SELECT release_year
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year
WHERE COUNT(title) > 10;
This means that if you want to filter based on the result of an aggregate function, you need another way! That's where the HAVING clause comes in. For example,

SELECT release_year
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year
HAVING COUNT(title) > 10;
shows only those years in which more than 10 films were released.

In how many different years were more than 200 movies released?

-- You can test out queries here!
SELECT release_year
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year
HAVING COUNT(title) > 200;

EXERCISE
All together now
Time to practice using ORDER BY, GROUP BY and HAVING together.

Now you're going to write a query that returns the average budget and average gross earnings for films in each year after 1990, if the average budget is greater than $60 million.

This is going to be a big query, but you can handle it!

INSTRUCTIONS 

-- -- 1 Get the release year, budget and gross earnings for each film in the films table.
-- SELECT release_year, budget, gross
-- FROM films

-- -- 2 Modify your query so that only results after 1990 are included.
-- SELECT release_year, budget, gross
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year > 1990;

-- -- 3 Remove the budget and gross columns, and group your results by release year.
-- SELECT release_year
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year > 1990
-- GROUP BY release_year;

-- -- 4 Modify your query to add in the average budget and average gross earnings for the results you have so far. Alias your results as avg_budget and avg_gross, respectively.
-- SELECT release_year, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, AVG(gross) AS avg_gross
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year > 1990
-- GROUP BY release_year;

-- -- Modify your query so that only years with an average budget of greater than $60 million are included.
-- SELECT release_year, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, AVG(gross) AS avg_gross
-- FROM films
-- WHERE release_year > 1990
-- GROUP BY release_year
-- HAVING AVG(budget) > 60000000;

-- Finally, modify your query to order the results from highest average gross earnings to lowest.
SELECT release_year, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, AVG(gross) AS avg_gross
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 1990
GROUP BY release_year
HAVING AVG(budget) > 60000000
ORDER BY AVG(gross);

EXERCISE
All together now (2)
Great work! Now try another large query. This time, all in one go!

Remember, if you only want to return a certain number of results, you can use the LIMIT keyword to limit the number of rows returned

INSTRUCTIONS
-- select country, average budget, average gross
SELECT country, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, AVG(gross) AS avg_gross
-- from the films table
FROM films
-- group by country 
GROUP BY country
-- where the country has a title count greater than 10
HAVING COUNT(title) > 10
-- order by country
ORDER BY country
-- limit to only show 5 results
LIMIT 5

EXERCISE
A taste of things to come
Congrats on making it to the end of the course! By now you should have a good understanding of the basics of SQL.

There's one more concept we're going to introduce. You may have noticed that all your results so far have been from just one table, e.g. films or people.

In the real world however, you will often want to query multiple tables. For example, what if you want to see the IMDB score for a particular movie?

In this case, you'd want to get the ID of the movie from the films table and then use it to get IMDB information from the reviews table. In SQL, this concept is known as a join, and a basic join is shown in the editor to the right.

The query in the editor gets the IMDB score for the film To Kill a Mockingbird! Cool right?

As you can see, joins are incredibly useful and important to understand for anyone using SQL.

We have a whole follow-up course dedicated to them called Joining Data in PostgreSQL for you to hone your database skills further!

INSTRUCTIONS
-- Submit the code in the editor and inspect the results.
SELECT title, imdb_score
FROM films
JOIN reviews
ON films.id = reviews.film_id
WHERE title = 'To Kill a Mockingbird';
