Task 1: Instructions
First, we need to import the Python libraries with which we will work.

Import numpy as np.
Import the class Image from the library PIL.
Create a numpy array called test_data that is a random array drawn from the beta distribution. The size should be (100, 100, 3) and the a and b parameters should both be 1. The distribution is in np.random.beta.
Call plt.imshow on the test data. You should see some colorful looking random noise!
Good to know
Welcome to the first project in a series on working with image data. We will be working through a Driven Data Competition to identify Honey Bees and Bumble Bees given an image of these insects! To learn more about the background, you can explore the competition page.

For this project, the documentation for Pillow, matplotlib, and numpy will be helpful resources! For more information about bees, see the BeeSpotter project or the DrivenData competition.

The recommended prerequisites for this Project are Intermediate Python for Data Science and Introduction to Data Visualization with Python.
