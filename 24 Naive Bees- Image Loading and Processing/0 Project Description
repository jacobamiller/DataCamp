24 Naive Bees: Image Loading and Processing

Project Description
This project is DataCamp's Project of the Week! XP for this project is tripled (4500 instead of 1500) from September 6th through September 13th.

Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this Project, you will use the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data. You'll learn common transformations of images and how to build them into a pipeline.

This project is the first part of a series of Projects that walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.

The recommended prerequisites for this Project are Intermediate Python for Data Science and Introduction to Data Visualization with Python.
