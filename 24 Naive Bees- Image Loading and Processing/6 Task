6 Task

Task 6: Instructions
Now we'll load the honey bee image and inspect its colors with a plot.

Use PIL's Image.open method to assign honey to the image at the path 'datasets/bee_12.jpg'.
Display the honey image.
For honey, create a NumPy array of the data and assign it to honey_data.
Plot the channels in honey_data with plot_rgb.

6. Honey bees and bumble bees (i)
Now we'll look at two different images and some of the differences between them. The first image is of a honey bee, and the second image is of a bumble bee.

First, let's look at the honey bee.


# load bee_12.jpg as honey
# ... YOUR CODE FOR TASK 6 ...
honey = Image.open('datasets/bee_12.jpg')
# display the honey bee image
display(honey)
â€‹
# NumPy array of the honey bee image data
# ... YOUR CODE FOR TASK 6 ...
honey_data = np.array(honey)
# plot the rgb densities for the honey bee image
plot_rgb(honey_data)
