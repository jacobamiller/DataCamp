Task 7: Instructions
Now we'll load the bumble bee image and inspect its colors with a plot.

Use PIL's Image.open method to assign bumble to the image at the path 'datasets/bee_3.jpg'.
Display the bumble image.
For bumble, create a NumPy array of the data and assign it to bumble_data.
Plot the channels in bumble_data with plot_rgb.

7. Honey bees and bumble bees (ii)
Now let's look at the bumble bee.

When one compares these images, it is clear how different the colors are. The honey bee image above, with a blue flower, has a strong peak on the right-hand side of the blue channel. The bumble bee image, which has a lot of yellow for the bee and the background, has almost perfect overlap between the red and green channels (which together make yellow).
