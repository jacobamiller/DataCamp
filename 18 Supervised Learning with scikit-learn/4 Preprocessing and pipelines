4 Preprocessing and pipelines
This chapter will introduce the notion of pipelines and how scikit-learn allows for transformers and estimators to be chained together and used as a single unit. Pre-processing techniques will be then be introduced as a way to enhance model performance and pipelines will be the glue that ties together concepts in the prior chapters.

EXERCISE
Exploring categorical features
The Gapminder dataset that you worked with in previous chapters also contained a categorical 'Region' feature, which we dropped in previous exercises since you did not have the tools to deal with it. Now however, you do, so we have added it back in!

Your job in this exercise is to explore this feature. Boxplots are particularly useful for visualizing categorical features such as this.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Import pandas as pd.
Read the CSV file 'gapminder.csv' into a DataFrame called df.
Use pandas to create a boxplot showing the variation of life expectancy ('life') by region ('Region'). To do so, pass the column names in to df.boxplot() (in that order).
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Read 'gapminder.csv' into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv('gapminder.csv')

# Create a boxplot of life expectancy per region
df.boxplot('life', 'Region', rot=60)

# Show the plot
plt.show()

EXERCISE
Creating dummy variables
As Andy discussed in the video, scikit-learn does not accept non-numerical features. You saw in the previous exercise that the 'Region' feature contains very useful information that can predict life expectancy. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa has a lower life expectancy compared to Europe and Central Asia. Therefore, if you are trying to predict life expectancy, it would be preferable to retain the 'Region' feature. To do this, you need to binarize it by creating dummy variables, which is what you will do in this exercise.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Use the pandas get_dummies() function to create dummy variables from the df DataFrame. Store the result as df_region.
Print the columns of df_region. This has been done for you.
Use the get_dummies() function again, this time specifying drop_first=True to drop the unneeded dummy variable (in this case, 'Region_America').
Hit 'Submit Answer to print the new columns of df_region and take note of how one column was dropped!
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Create dummy variables: df_region
df_region = pd.get_dummies(df)

# Print the columns of df_region
print(df_region.columns)

# Create dummy variables with drop_first=True: df_region
df_region = pd.get_dummies(df, drop_first=True)

# Print the new columns of df_region
print(df_region.columns)

EXERCISE
Regression with categorical features
Having created the dummy variables from the 'Region' feature, you can build regression models as you did before. Here, you'll use ridge regression to perform 5-fold cross-validation.

The feature array X and target variable array y have been pre-loaded.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Import Ridge from sklearn.linear_model and cross_val_score from sklearn.model_selection.
Instantiate a ridge regressor called ridge with alpha=0.5 and normalize=True.
Perform 5-fold cross-validation on X and y using the cross_val_score() function.
Print the cross-validated scores.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Instantiate a ridge regressor: ridge
ridge = Ridge(alpha=0.5, normalize=True)

# Perform 5-fold cross-validation: ridge_cv
ridge_cv = cross_val_score(ridge, X, y, cv=5)

# Print the cross-validated scores
print(ridge_cv)

EXERCISE
Dropping missing data
The voting dataset from Chapter 1 contained a bunch of missing values that we dealt with for you behind the scenes. Now, it's time for you to take care of these yourself!

The unprocessed dataset has been loaded into a DataFrame df. Explore it in the IPython Shell with the .head() method. You will see that there are certain data points labeled with a '?'. These denote missing values. As you saw in the video, different datasets encode missing values in different ways. Sometimes it may be a '9999', other times a 0 - real-world data can be very messy! If you're lucky, the missing values will already be encoded as NaN. We use NaN because it is an efficient and simplified way of internally representing missing data, and it lets us take advantage of pandas methods such as .dropna() and .fillna(), as well as scikit-learn's Imputation transformer Imputer().

In this exercise, your job is to convert the '?'s to NaNs, and then drop the rows that contain them from the DataFrame.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Explore the DataFrame df in the IPython Shell. Notice how the missing value is represented.
Convert all '?' data points to np.nan.
Count the total number of NaNs using the .isnull() and .sum() methods. This has been done for you.
Drop the rows with missing values from df using .dropna().
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see how many rows were lost by dropping the missing values.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Convert '?' to NaN
df[df == '?'] = np.NaN

# Print the number of NaNs
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Print shape of original DataFrame
print("Shape of Original DataFrame: {}".format(df.shape))

# Drop missing values and print shape of new DataFrame
df = df.dropna()

# Print shape of new DataFrame
print("Shape of DataFrame After Dropping All Rows with Missing Values: {}".format(df.shape))

# Great work! When many values in your dataset are missing, if you drop them, you may end up throwing away valuable information along with the missing data. It's better instead to develop an imputation strategy. This is where domain knowledge is useful, but in the absence of it, you can impute missing values with the mean or the median of the row or column that the missing value is in.

EXERCISE
Imputing missing data in a ML Pipeline I
As you've come to appreciate, there are many steps to building a model, from creating training and test sets, to fitting a classifier or regressor, to tuning its parameters, to evaluating its performance on new data. Imputation can be seen as the first step of this machine learning process, the entirety of which can be viewed within the context of a pipeline. Scikit-learn provides a pipeline constructor that allows you to piece together these steps into one process and thereby simplify your workflow.

You'll now practice setting up a pipeline with two steps: the imputation step, followed by the instantiation of a classifier. You've seen three classifiers in this course so far: k-NN, logistic regression, and the decision tree. You will now be introduced to a fourth one - the Support Vector Machine, or SVM. For now, do not worry about how it works under the hood. It works exactly as you would expect of the scikit-learn estimators that you have worked with previously, in that it has the same .fit() and .predict() methods as before.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Import Imputer from sklearn.preprocessing and SVC from sklearn.svm. SVC stands for Support Vector Classification, which is a type of SVM.
Setup the Imputation transformer to impute missing data (represented as 'NaN') with the 'most_frequent' value in the column (axis=0).
Instantiate a SVC classifier. Store the result in clf.
Create the steps of the pipeline by creating a list of tuples:
The first tuple should consist of the imputation step, using imp.
The second should consist of the classifier.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Import the Imputer module
from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer
from sklearn.svm import SVC


# Setup the Imputation transformer: imp
imp = Imputer(missing_values='NaN', strategy='most_frequent', axis=0)

# Instantiate the SVC classifier: clf
clf = SVC()

# Setup the pipeline with the required steps: steps
steps = [('imputation', imp),
        ('SVM', clf)]

# Fantastic! Having set up the pipeline steps, you can now use it for classification.

EXERCISE
Imputing missing data in a ML Pipeline II
Having setup the steps of the pipeline in the previous exercise, you will now use it on the voting dataset to classify a Congressman's party affiliation. What makes pipelines so incredibly useful is the simple interface that they provide. You can use the .fit() and .predict() methods on pipelines just as you did with your classifiers and regressors!

Practice this for yourself now and generate a classification report of your predictions. The steps of the pipeline have been set up for you, and the feature array X and target variable array y have been pre-loaded. Additionally, train_test_split and classification_report have been imported from sklearn.model_selection and sklearn.metrics respectively.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Import the following modules:
Imputer from sklearn.preprocessing and Pipeline from sklearn.pipeline.
SVC from sklearn.svm.
Create the pipeline using Pipeline() and steps.
Create training and test sets. Use 30% of the data for testing and a random state of 42.
Fit the pipeline to the training set and predict the labels of the test set.
Compute the classification report.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Setup the pipeline steps: steps
steps = [('imputation', Imputer(missing_values='NaN', strategy='most_frequent', axis=0)),
        ('SVM', SVC())]

# Create the pipeline: pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(steps)

# Create training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42) 

# Fit the pipeline to the train set
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the labels of the test set
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)

# Compute metrics
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Great work! Your pipeline has performed imputation as well as classification!
