5 Putting it all together: a case study
Every year for the past 40-plus years, Peter and Rosemary Grant have gone to the GalÃ¡pagos island of Daphne Major and collected data on Darwin's finches. Using your skills in statistical inference, you will spend this chapter with their data, and witness first hand, through data, evolution in action. It's an exhilarating way to end the course!

EXERCISE
EDA of beak depths of Darwin's finches
For your first foray into the Darwin finch data, you will study how the beak depth (the distance, top to bottom, of a closed beak) of the finch species Geospiza scandens has changed over time. The Grants have noticed some changes of beak geometry depending on the types of seeds available on the island, and they also noticed that there was some interbreeding with another major species on Daphne Major, Geospiza fortis. These effects can lead to changes in the species over time.

In the next few problems, you will look at the beak depth of G. scandens on Daphne Major in 1975 and in 2012. To start with, let's plot all of the beak depth measurements in 1975 and 2012 in a bee swarm plot.

The data are stored in a pandas DataFrame called df with columns 'year' and 'beak_depth'. The units of beak depth are millimeters (mm).

# Create bee swarm plot
_ = sns.swarmplot(data=df, x='year', y='beak_depth')

# Label the axes
_ = plt.xlabel('year')
_ = plt.ylabel('beak depth (mm)')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

It is kind of hard to see if there is a clear difference between the 1975 and 2012 data set. Eyeballing it, 
it appears as though the mean of the 2012 data set might be slightly higher, and it might have a bigger variance.

EXERCISE
ECDFs of beak depths
While bee swarm plots are useful, we found that ECDFs are often even better when doing EDA. Plot the ECDFs for the 1975 and 2012 beak depth measurements on the same plot.

For your convenience, the beak depths for the respective years has been stored in the NumPy arrays bd_1975 and bd_2012.

# Compute ECDFs
x_1975, y_1975 = ecdf(bd_1975)
x_2012, y_2012 = ecdf(bd_2012)

# Plot the ECDFs
_ = plt.plot(x_1975, y_1975, marker='.', linestyle='none')
_ = plt.plot(x_2012, y_2012, marker='.', linestyle='none')

# Set margins
plt.margins(0.02)

# Add axis labels and legend
_ = plt.xlabel('beak depth (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')
_ = plt.legend(('1975', '2012'), loc='lower right')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

The differences are much clearer in the ECDF. The mean is larger in the 2012 data, and the variance does appear larger as well.

EXERCISE
Parameter estimates of beak depths
Estimate the difference of the mean beak depth of the G. scandens samples from 1975 and 2012 and report a 95% confidence interval.

Since in this exercise you will use the draw_bs_reps() function you wrote in chapter 2, it may be helpful to refer back to it.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Compute the difference of the sample means.
Take 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean for the 1975 beak depths using your draw_bs_reps() function. Also get 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean for the 2012 beak depths.
Subtract the 1975 replicates from the 2012 replicates to get bootstrap replicates of the difference of means.
Use the replicates to compute the 95% confidence interval.

# Compute the difference of the sample means: mean_diff
mean_diff = np.mean(bd_2012) - np.mean(bd_1975)

# Get bootstrap replicates of means
bs_replicates_1975 = draw_bs_reps(bd_1975, np.mean, 10000)
bs_replicates_2012 = draw_bs_reps(bd_2012, np.mean, 10000)

# Compute samples of difference of means: bs_diff_replicates
bs_diff_replicates = bs_replicates_2012 - bs_replicates_1975

# Compute 95% confidence interval: conf_int
conf_int = np.percentile(bs_diff_replicates, [2.5, 97.5])

# Print the results
print('difference of means =', mean_diff, 'mm')
print('95% confidence interval =', conf_int, 'mm')

EXERCISE
Hypothesis test: Are beaks deeper in 2012?
Your plot of the ECDF and determination of the confidence interval make it pretty clear that the beaks of G. scandens on Daphne Major have gotten deeper. But is it possible that this effect is just due to random chance? In other words, what is the probability that we would get the observed difference in mean beak depth if the means were the same?

Be careful! The hypothesis we are testing is not that the beak depths come from the same distribution. For that we could use a permutation test. The hypothesis is that the means are equal. To perform this hypothesis test, we need to shift the two data sets so that they have the same mean and then use bootstrap sampling to compute the difference of means.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Make a concatenated array of the 1975 and 2012 beak depths and compute and store its mean.
Shift bd_1975 and bd_2012 such that their means are equal to the one you just computed for the combined data set.
Take 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean each for the 1975 and 2012 beak depths.
Subtract the 1975 replicates from the 2012 replicates to get bootstrap replicates of the difference.
Compute and print the p-value. The observed difference in means you computed in the last exercise is still in your namespace as mean_diff.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Compute mean of combined data set: combined_mean
combined_mean = np.mean(np.concatenate((bd_1975, bd_2012)))

# Shift the samples
bd_1975_shifted = bd_1975 - np.mean(bd_1975) + combined_mean
bd_2012_shifted = bd_2012 - np.mean(bd_2012) + combined_mean

# Get bootstrap replicates of shifted data sets
bs_replicates_1975 = draw_bs_reps(bd_1975_shifted, np.mean, 10000)
bs_replicates_2012 = draw_bs_reps(bd_2012_shifted, np.mean, 10000)

# Compute replicates of difference of means: bs_diff_replicates
bs_diff_replicates = bs_replicates_2012 - bs_replicates_1975

# Compute the p-value
p = np.sum(bs_diff_replicates >= mean_diff) / len(bs_diff_replicates)

# Print p-value
print('p =', p)

We get a p-value of 0.0034, which suggests that there is a statistically significant difference. 
But remember: it is very important to know how different they are! In the previous exercise, you got a difference of 
0.2 mm between the means. You should combine this with the statistical significance. Changing by 0.2 mm in 37 years is 
substantial by evolutionary standards. If it kept changing at that rate, the beak depth would double in only 400 years.

EXERCISE
EDA of beak length and depth
The beak length data are stored as bl_1975 and bl_2012, again with units of millimeters (mm). You still have the beak depth data stored in bd_1975 and bd_2012. Make scatter plots of beak depth (y-axis) versus beak length (x-axis) for the 1975 and 2012 specimens.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Make a scatter plot of the 1975 data. Use the color='blue' keyword argument. Also use an alpha=0.5 keyword argument to have transparency in case data points overlap.
Do the same for the 2012 data, but use the color='red' keyword argument.
Add a legend and label the axes.
Show your plot.

# Make scatter plot of 1975 data

Great work! In looking at the plot, we see that beaks got deeper (the red points are higher up in the y-direction), 
but not really longer. If anything, they got a bit shorter, since the red dots are to the left of the blue dots. 
So, it does not look like the beaks kept the same shape; they became shorter and deeper.
