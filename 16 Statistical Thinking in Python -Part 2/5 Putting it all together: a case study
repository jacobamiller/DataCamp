5 Putting it all together: a case study
Every year for the past 40-plus years, Peter and Rosemary Grant have gone to the Gal√°pagos island of Daphne Major and collected data on Darwin's finches. Using your skills in statistical inference, you will spend this chapter with their data, and witness first hand, through data, evolution in action. It's an exhilarating way to end the course!
