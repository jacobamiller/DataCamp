These are my class notes from DataCamp's Data Scientist with Python Career Track that I finished in Sep 2018

At the start of the program, I did not know how to use GitHub well so my notes improved more and more as I reached the end of the program

A Data Scientist combines statistical and machine learning techniques with Python programming to analyze and interpret complex data.
