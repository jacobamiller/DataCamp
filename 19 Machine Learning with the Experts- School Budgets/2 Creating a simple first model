2 Creating a simple first model
In this chapter, you'll build a first-pass model. You'll use numeric data only to train the model. Spoiler alert - throwing out all of the text data is bad for performance! But you'll learn how to format your predictions. Then, you'll be introduced to natural language processing (NLP) in order to start working with the large amounts of text in the data.

EXERCISE
Setting up a train-test split in scikit-learn
Alright, you've been patient and awesome. It's finally time to start training models!

The first step is to split the data into a training set and a test set. Some labels don't occur very often, but we want to make sure that they appear in both the training and the test sets. We provide a function that will make sure at least min_count examples of each label appear in each split: multilabel_train_test_split.

Feel free to check out the full code for multilabel_train_test_split here.

You'll start with a simple model that uses just the numeric columns of your DataFrame when calling multilabel_train_test_split. The data has been read into a DataFrame df and a list consisting of just the numeric columns is available as NUMERIC_COLUMNS.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Create a new DataFrame named numeric_data_only by applying the .fillna(-1000) method to the numeric columns (available in the list NUMERIC_COLUMNS) of df.
Convert the labels (available in the list LABELS) to dummy variables. Save the result as label_dummies.
In the call to multilabel_train_test_split(), set the size of your test set to be 0.2. Use a seed of 123.
Fill in the .info() method calls for X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test.
