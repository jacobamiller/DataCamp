4 Bringing it all together
In this final chapter of the course, you'll consolidate everything you've learned by diving into an in-depth case study of GitHub collaborator network data. This is a great example of real-world social network data, and your newly acquired skills will be fully tested. By the end of this chapter, you'll have developed your very own recommendation system which suggests GitHub users who should collaborate together. Enjoy!
