2 Important nodes
Here, you'll learn about ways of identifying nodes that are important in a network. In doing so, you'll be introduced to more advanced concepts in network analysis as well as learn the basics of path-finding algorithms. The chapter concludes with a deep dive into the Twitter network dataset which will reinforce the concepts you've learned, such as degree centrality and betweenness centrality.
