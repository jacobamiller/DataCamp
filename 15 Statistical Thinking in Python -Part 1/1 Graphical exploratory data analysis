1 Graphical exploratory data analysis
Look before you leap! A very important proverb, indeed. Prior to diving in headlong into sophisticated statistical inference techniques, you should first explore your data by plotting them and computing simple summary statistics. This process, called exploratory data analysis, is a crucial first step in statistical analysis of data. So it is a fitting subject for the first chapter of Statistical Thinking in Python.

EXERCISE
Plotting a histogram of iris data
For the exercises in this section, you will use a classic data set collected by botanist Edward Anderson and made famous by Ronald Fisher, one of the most prolific statisticians in history. Anderson carefully measured the anatomical properties of samples of three different species of iris, Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The full data set is available as part of scikit-learn. Here, you will work with his measurements of petal length.

Plot a histogram of the petal lengths of his 50 samples of Iris versicolor using matplotlib/seaborn's default settings. Recall that to specify the default seaborn style, you can use sns.set(), where sns is the alias that seaborn is imported as.

The subset of the data set containing the Iris versicolor petal lengths in units of centimeters (cm) is stored in the NumPy array versicolor_petal_length.

In the video, Justin plotted the histograms by using the pandas library and indexing the DataFrame to extract the desired column. Here, however, you only need to use the provided NumPy array. Also, Justin assigned his plotting statements (except for plt.show()) to the dummy variable _. This is to prevent unnecessary output from being displayed. It is not required for your solutions to these exercises, however it is good practice to use it. Alternatively, if you are working in an interactive environment such as a Jupyter notebook, you could use a ; after your plotting statements to achieve the same effect. Justin prefers using _. Therefore, you will see it used in the solution code.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Import matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn as their usual aliases (plt and sns).
Use seaborn to set the plotting defaults.
Plot a histogram of the Iris versicolor petal lengths using plt.hist() and the provided NumPy array versicolor_petal_length.
Show the histogram using plt.show().

# Import plotting modules
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns


# Set default Seaborn style
sns.set()

# Plot histogram of versicolor petal lengths
_ = plt.hist(versicolor_petal_length)

# Show histogram
plt.show()

EXERCISE
Axis labels!
In the last exercise, you made a nice histogram of petal lengths of Iris versicolor, but you didn't label the axes! That's ok; it's not your fault since we didn't ask you to. Now, add axis labels to the plot using plt.xlabel() and plt.ylabel(). Don't forget to add units and assign both statements to _. The packages matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn are already imported with their standard aliases. This will be the case in what follows, unless specified otherwise.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Label the axes. Don't forget that you should always include units in your axis labels. Your y-axis label is just 'count'. Your x-axis label is 'petal length (cm)'. The units are essential!
Display the plot constructed in the above steps using plt.show().
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Plot histogram of versicolor petal lengths
_ = plt.hist(versicolor_petal_length)

# Label axes
_ = plt.xlabel('petal length (cm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('count')

# Show histogram
plt.show()

EXERCISE
Adjusting the number of bins in a histogram
The histogram you just made had ten bins. This is the default of matplotlib. The "square root rule" is a commonly-used rule of thumb for choosing number of bins: choose the number of bins to be the square root of the number of samples. Plot the histogram of Iris versicolor petal lengths again, this time using the square root rule for the number of bins. You specify the number of bins using the bins keyword argument of plt.hist().

The plotting utilities are already imported and the seaborn defaults already set. The variable you defined in the last exercise, versicolor_petal_length, is already in your namespace.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Import numpy as np. This gives access to the square root function, np.sqrt().
Determine how many data points you have using len().
Compute the number of bins using the square root rule.
Convert the number of bins to an integer using the built in int() function.
Generate the histogram and make sure to use the bins keyword argument.

# Label axes
_ = plt.xlabel('petal length (cm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('count')

# Show histogram
plt.show()

EXERCISE
Bee swarm plot
Make a bee swarm plot of the iris petal lengths. Your x-axis should contain each of the three species, and the y-axis the petal lengths. A data frame containing the data is in your namespace as df.

For your reference, the code Justin used to create the bee swarm plot in the video is provided below:

_ = sns.swarmplot(x='state', y='dem_share', data=df_swing)
_ = plt.xlabel('state')
_ = plt.ylabel('percent of vote for Obama')
plt.show()
In the IPython Shell, you can use sns.swarmplot? or help(sns.swarmplot) for more details on how to make bee swarm plots using seaborn.

INSTRUCTIONS

In the IPython Shell, inspect the DataFrame df using df.head(). This will let you identify which column names you need to pass as the x and y keyword arguments in your call to sns.swarmplot().
Use sns.swarmplot() to make a bee swarm plot from the DataFrame containing the Fisher iris data set, df. The x-axis should contain each of the three species, and the y-axis should contain the petal lengths.

Answer #3 - I. virginica petals tend to be the longest, and I. setosa petals tend to be the shortest of the three species.

Correct! Notice that we said "tend to be." Some individual I. virginica flowers may be shorter than individual 
I. versicolor flowers. It is also possible that an individual 
I. setosa flower may have longer petals than in individual I. versicolor flower, 
though this is highly unlikely, and was not observed by Anderson.

EXERCISE
Computing the ECDF
In this exercise, you will write a function that takes as input a 1D array of data and then returns the x and y values of the ECDF. You will use this function over and over again throughout this course and its sequel. ECDFs are among the most important plots in statistical analysis. You can write your own function, foo(x,y) according to the following skeleton:

def foo(a,b):
    """State what function does here"""
    # Computation performed here
    return x, y
The function foo() above takes two arguments a and b and returns two values x and y. The function header def foo(a,b): contains the function signature foo(a,b), which consists of the function name, along with its parameters. For more on writing your own functions, see DataCamp's course Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1) here!

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Define a function with the signature ecdf(data). Within the function definition,
Compute the number of data points, n, using the len() function.
The x-values are the sorted data. Use the np.sort() function to perform the sorting.
The y data of the ECDF go from 1/n to 1 in equally spaced increments. You can construct this using np.arange(). Remember, however, that the end value in np.arange() is not inclusive. Therefore, np.arange() will need to go from 1 to n+1. Be sure to divide this by n.
The function returns the values x and y.

import numpy as np #Dont beleive this line is really needed 

def ecdf(data):
    """Compute ECDF for a one-dimensional array of measurements."""

    # Number of data points: n
    n = len(data)

    # x-data for the ECDF: x
    x = np.sort(data)

    # y-data for the ECDF: y
    y = np.arange(1, n+1) / n

    return x, y

EXERCISE
Plotting the ECDF
You will now use your ecdf() function to compute the ECDF for the petal lengths of Anderson's Iris versicolor flowers. You will then plot the ECDF. Recall that your ecdf() function returns two arrays so you will need to unpack them. An example of such unpacking is x, y = foo(data), for some function foo().

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Use ecdf() to compute the ECDF of versicolor_petal_length. Unpack the output into x_vers and y_vers.
Plot the ECDF as dots. Remember to include marker = '.' and linestyle = 'none' in addition to x_vers and y_vers as arguments inside plt.plot().
Label the axes. You can label the y-axis 'ECDF'.
Show your plot.

# Compute ECDF for versicolor data: x_vers, y_vers
x_vers, y_vers = ecdf(versicolor_petal_length)

# Generate plot
plt.plot(x_vers, y_vers, marker = '.', linestyle = 'none')

# Label the axes
_ = plt.xlabel('length')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')


# Display the plot
plt.show()

EXERCISE
Comparison of ECDFs
ECDFs also allow you to compare two or more distributions (though plots get cluttered if you have too many). Here, you will plot ECDFs for the petal lengths of all three iris species. You already wrote a function to generate ECDFs so you can put it to good use!

To overlay all three ECDFs on the same plot, you can use plt.plot() three times, once for each ECDF. Remember to include marker='.' and linestyle='none' as arguments inside plt.plot().

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Compute ECDFs for each of the three species using your ecdf() function. The variables setosa_petal_length, versicolor_petal_length, and virginica_petal_length are all in your namespace. Unpack the ECDFs into x_set, y_set, x_vers, y_vers and x_virg, y_virg, respectively.
Plot all three ECDFs on the same plot as dots. To do this, you will need three plt.plot() commands. Assign the result of each to _.
