3 Time series in pandas
In this chapter, you will learn how to manipulate and visualize time series data using Pandas. You will become familiar with concepts such as upsampling, downsampling, and interpolation. You will practice using Pandas' method chaining to efficiently filter your data and perform time series analyses. From stock prices to flight timings, time series data are found in a wide variety of domains and being able to effectively work with such data can be an invaluable skill.

EXERCISE
Reading and slicing times
For this exercise, we have read in the same data file using three different approaches:

df1 = pd.read_csv(filename)

df2 = pd.read_csv(filename, parse_dates=['Date'])

df3 = pd.read_csv(filename, index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)

Use the .head() and .info() methods in the IPython Shell to inspect the DataFrames. Then, try to index each DataFrame with a datetime string. Which of the resulting DataFrames allows you to easily index and slice data by dates using, for example, df1.loc['2010-Aug-01']?
