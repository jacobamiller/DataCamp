EXERCISE
Reading and slicing times
For this exercise, we have read in the same data file using three different approaches:

df1 = pd.read_csv(filename)

df2 = pd.read_csv(filename, parse_dates=['Date'])

df3 = pd.read_csv(filename, index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)

Use the .head() and .info() methods in the IPython Shell to inspect the DataFrames. Then, try to index each DataFrame with a datetime string. Which of the resulting DataFrames allows you to easily index and slice data by dates using, for example, df1.loc['2010-Aug-01']?

EXERCISE
Creating and using a DatetimeIndex
The pandas Index is a powerful way to handle time series data, so it is valuable to know how to build one yourself. Pandas provides the pd.to_datetime() function for just this task. For example, if passed the list of strings ['2015-01-01 091234','2015-01-01 091234'] and a format specification variable, such as format='%Y-%m-%d %H%M%S, pandas will parse the string into the proper datetime elements and build the datetime objects.

In this exercise, a list of temperature data and a list of date strings has been pre-loaded for you as temperature_list and date_list respectively. Your job is to use the .to_datetime() method to build a DatetimeIndex out of the list of date strings, and to then use it along with the list of temperature data to build a pandas Series.

INSTRUCTIONS
50 XP
Prepare a format string, time_format, using '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M' as the desired format.
Convert date_list into a datetime object by using the pd.to_datetime() function. Specify the format string you defined above and assign the result to my_datetimes.
Construct a pandas Series called time_series using pd.Series() with temperature_list and my_datetimes. Set the index of the Series to be my_datetimes.

# Prepare a format string: time_format
time_format = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'

# Convert date_list into a datetime object: my_datetimes
my_datetimes = pd.to_datetime(date_list, format=time_format)  

# Construct a pandas Series using temperature_list and my_datetimes: time_series
time_series = pd.Series(temperature_list, index=my_datetimes)

EXERCISE
Partial string indexing and slicing
Pandas time series support "partial string" indexing. What this means is that even when passed only a portion of the datetime, such as the date but not the time, pandas is remarkably good at doing what one would expect. Pandas datetime indexing also supports a wide variety of commonly used datetime string formats, even when mixed.

In this exercise, a time series that contains hourly weather data has been pre-loaded for you. This data was read using the parse_dates=True option in read_csv() with index_col="Dates" so that the Index is indeed a DatetimeIndex.

All data from the 'Temperature' column has been extracted into the variable ts0. Your job is to use a variety of natural date strings to extract one or more values from ts0.

After you are done, you will have three new variables - ts1, ts2, and ts3. You can slice these further to extract only the first and last entries of each. Try doing this after your submission for more practice.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Extract data from ts0 for a single hour - the hour from 9pm to 10pm on 2010-10-11. Assign it to ts1.
Extract data from ts0 for a single day - July 4th, 2010 - and assign it to ts2.
Extract data from ts0 for the second half of December 2010 - 12/15/2010 to 12/31/2010. Assign it to ts3.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Extract the hour from 9pm to 10pm on '2010-10-11': ts1
ts1 = ts0.loc['2010-10-11 21:00:00':'2010-10-11 22:00:00']

# Extract '2010-07-04' from ts0: ts2
ts2 = ts0.loc['2010-07-04']

# Extract data from '2010-12-15' to '2010-12-31': ts3
ts3 = ts0.loc['2010-12-15':'2010-12-31']

EXERCISE
Reindexing the Index
Reindexing is useful in preparation for adding or otherwise combining two time series data sets. To reindex the data, we provide a new index and ask pandas to try and match the old data to the new index. If data is unavailable for one of the new index dates or times, you must tell pandas how to fill it in. Otherwise, pandas will fill with NaN by default.

In this exercise, two time series data sets containing daily data have been pre-loaded for you, each indexed by dates. The first, ts1, includes weekends, but the second, ts2, does not. The goal is to combine the two data sets in a sensible way. Your job is to reindex the second data set so that it has weekends as well, and then add it to the first. When you are done, it would be informative to inspect your results.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Create a new time series ts3 by reindexing ts2 with the index of ts1. To do this, call .reindex() on ts2 and pass in the index of ts1 (ts1.index).
Create another new time series, ts4, by calling the same .reindex() as above, but also specifiying a fill method, using the keyword argument method="ffill" to forward-fill values.
Add ts1 + ts2. Assign the result to sum12.
Add ts1 + ts3. Assign the result to sum13.
Add ts1 + ts4, Assign the result to sum14.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Reindex without fill method: ts3
ts3 = ts2.reindex(ts1.index)

# Reindex with fill method, using forward fill: ts4
ts4 = ts2.reindex(ts1.index, method="ffill")

# Combine ts1 + ts2: sum12
sum12 = ts1 + ts2

# Combine ts1 + ts3: sum13
sum13 = ts1 + ts3

# Combine ts1 + ts4: sum14
sum14 = ts1 + ts4

EXERCISE
Resampling and frequency
Pandas provides methods for resampling time series data. When downsampling or upsampling, the syntax is similar, but the methods called are different. Both use the concept of 'method chaining' - df.method1().method2().method3() - to direct the output from one method call to the input of the next, and so on, as a sequence of operations, one feeding into the next.

For example, if you have hourly data, and just need daily data, pandas will not guess how to throw out the 23 of 24 points. You must specify this in the method. One approach, for instance, could be to take the mean, as in df.resample('D').mean().

In this exercise, a data set containing hourly temperature data has been pre-loaded for you. Your job is to resample the data using a variety of aggregation methods to answer a few questions.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Downsample the 'Temperature' column of df to 6 hour data using .resample('6h') and .mean(). Assign the result to df1.
Downsample the 'Temperature' column of df to daily data using .resample('D') and then count the number of data points in each day with .count(). Assign the result df2.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Downsample to 6 hour data and aggregate by mean: df1
df1 = df['Temperature'].resample('6H').mean()

# Downsample to daily data and count the number of data points: df2
df2 = df['Temperature'].resample('D').count()

EXERCISE
Separating and resampling
With pandas, you can resample in different ways on different subsets of your data. For example, resampling different months of data with different aggregations. In this exercise, the data set containing hourly temperature data from the last exercise has been pre-loaded.

Your job is to resample the data using a variety of aggregation methods. The DataFrame is available in the workspace as df. You will be working with the 'Temperature' column.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Use partial string indexing to extract temperature data for August 2010 into august.
Use the temperature data for August and downsample to find the daily maximum temperatures. Store the result in august_highs.
Use partial string indexing to extract temperature data for February 2010 into february.
Use the temperature data for February and downsample to find the daily minimum temperatures. Store the result in february_lows.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Extract temperature data for August: august
august = df['Temperature']['2010-August']

# Downsample to obtain only the daily highest temperatures in August: august_highs
august_highs = august.resample('D').max()

# Extract temperature data for February: february
february = df['Temperature']['2010-February']

# Downsample to obtain the daily lowest temperatures in February: february_lows
february_lows = february.resample('D').min()

EXERCISE
Rolling mean and frequency
In this exercise, some hourly weather data is pre-loaded for you. You will continue to practice resampling, this time using rolling means.

Rolling means (or moving averages) are generally used to smooth out short-term fluctuations in time series data and highlight long-term trends. You can read more about them here.

To use the .rolling() method, you must always use method chaining, first calling .rolling() and then chaining an aggregation method after it. For example, with a Series hourly_data, hourly_data.rolling(window=24).mean() would compute new values for each hourly point, based on a 24-hour window stretching out behind each point. The frequency of the output data is the same: it is still hourly. Such an operation is useful for smoothing time series data.

Your job is to resample the data using the combination of .rolling() and .mean(). You will work with the same DataFrame df from the previous exercise.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Use partial string indexing to extract temperature data from August 1 2010 to August 15 2010. Assign to unsmoothed.
Use .rolling() with a 24 hour window to smooth the mean temperature data. Assign the result to smoothed.
Use a dictionary to create a new DataFrame august with the time series smoothed and unsmoothed as columns.
Plot both the columns of august as line plots using the .plot() method.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Extract data from 2010-Aug-01 to 2010-Aug-15: unsmoothed
unsmoothed = df['Temperature']['August 1 2010':'August 15 2010']

# Apply a rolling mean with a 24 hour window: smoothed
smoothed = unsmoothed.rolling(window=24).mean()

# Create a new DataFrame with columns smoothed and unsmoothed: august
august = pd.DataFrame({'smoothed':smoothed, 'unsmoothed':unsmoothed})

# Plot both smoothed and unsmoothed data using august.plot().
august.plot()
plt.show()

EXERCISE
Resample and roll with it
As of pandas version 0.18.0, the interface for applying rolling transformations to time series has become more consistent and flexible, and feels somewhat like a groupby (If you do not know what a groupby is, don't worry, you will learn about it in the next course!).

You can now flexibly chain together resampling and rolling operations. In this exercise, the same weather data from the previous exercises has been pre-loaded for you. Your job is to extract one month of data, resample to find the daily high temperatures, and then use a rolling and aggregation operation to smooth the data.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Use partial string indexing to extract August 2010 temperature data, and assign to august.
Resample to daily frequency, saving the maximum daily temperatures, and assign the result to daily_highs.
As part of one long method chain, repeat the above resampling (or you can re-use daily_highs) and then combine it with .rolling() to apply a 7 day .mean() (with window=7 inside .rolling()) so as to smooth the daily highs. Assign the result to daily_highs_smoothed and print the result.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Extract the August 2010 data: august
august = df['Temperature']['2010-August']

# Resample to daily data, aggregating by max: daily_highs
daily_highs = august.resample('D').max()

# Use a rolling 7-day window with method chaining to smooth the daily high temperatures in August
daily_highs_smoothed = daily_highs.rolling(window=7).mean()
print(daily_highs_smoothed)

EXERCISE
Method chaining and filtering
We've seen that pandas supports method chaining. This technique can be very powerful when cleaning and filtering data.

In this exercise, a DataFrame containing flight departure data for a single airline and a single airport for the month of July 2015 has been pre-loaded. Your job is to use .str() filtering and method chaining to generate summary statistics on flight delays each day to Dallas.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Use .str.strip() to strip extra whitespace from df.columns. Assign the result back to df.columns.
In the 'Destination Airport' column, extract all entries where Dallas ('DAL') is the destination airport. Use .str.contains('DAL') for this and store the result in dallas.
Resample dallas such that you get the total number of departures each day. Store the result in daily_departures.
Generate summary statistics for daily Dallas departures using .describe(). Store the result in stats.
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Strip extra whitespace from the column names: df.columns
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip(' ')

# Extract data for which the destination airport is Dallas: dallas
dallas = df['Destination Airport'].str.contains('DAL')

# Compute the total number of Dallas departures each day: daily_departures
daily_departures = dallas.resample('D').sum()

# Generate the summary statistics for daily Dallas departures: stats
stats = daily_departures.describe()

EXERCISE
Missing values and interpolation
One common application of interpolation in data analysis is to fill in missing data.

In this exercise, noisy measured data that has some dropped or otherwise missing values has been loaded. The goal is to compare two time series, and then look at summary statistics of the differences. The problem is that one of the data sets is missing data at some of the times. The pre-loaded data ts1 has value for all times, yet the data set ts2 does not: it is missing data for the weekends.

Your job is to first interpolate to fill in the data for all days. Then, compute the differences between the two data sets, now that they both have full support for all times. Finally, generate the summary statistics that describe the distribution of differences.

INSTRUCTIONS
100 XP
Replace the index of ts2 with that of ts1, and then fill in the missing values of ts2 by using .interpolate(how='linear'). Save the result as ts2_interp.
Compute the difference between ts1 and ts2_interp. Take the absolute value of the difference with np.abs(), and assign the result to differences.
Generate and print summary statistics of the differences with .describe() and print().
Take Hint (-30 XP)

# Reset the index of ts2 to ts1, and then use linear interpolation to fill in the NaNs: ts2_interp
ts2_interp = ts2.reindex(ts1.index).interpolate(how='linear')

# Compute the absolute difference of ts1 and ts2_interp: differences 
differences = np.abs(ts1 - ts2_interp)

# Generate and print summary statistics of the differences
print(differences.describe())
