2 Plotting 2D arrays
This chapter showcases various techniques for visualizing two-dimensional arrays. This includes the use, presentation, and orientation of grids for representing two-variable functions followed by discussions of pseudocolor plots, contour plots, color maps, two-dimensional histograms, and images.
