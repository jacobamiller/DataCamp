3 Building deep learning models with keras
In this chapter, you'll use the keras library to build deep learning models for both regression as well as classification! You'll learn about the Specify-Compile-Fit workflow that you can use to make predictions and by the end of this chapter, you'll have all the tools necessary to build deep neural networks!
